Jason is basically the immortal god of block of woods. Below is a picture of him:

You have a pet block of wood and you want him to be as strong and as huge as Jason. That is what you do in jasonism

When you make an account, your block is made out of one block, you have 0 XP and ∆0. You can earn XP and ∆ by doing:
- [mental calculations](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/mencalc)
- [trivia questions](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/trivia)
- [unscramble word](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/unscrambleword)

You can win or lose ∆ by doing:
- [challenging someone to rock paper scissors](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/challengerps)
- [flipping coins](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/flipcoin)
- [rolling die](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/rolldice)
- [cup gaming](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/cupgame)
- [rock paper scissoring](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/rps)

You also have levels. The level you are in is the number of XP you have, divided by 1000, rounded to the closest whole number below, plus 1 (or you can just check your profile). The level you are on is the maximum amount of block your block is made out of.

You can make your block HUGER if you meet these two requirements:
-  The level you are on is bigger than the amount of blocks in your block
- You have more than ∆10000

A block in your block is the area the main block increases when you make your block HUGER once.
You can also make your block prettier by [spending your ∆ on things for your block](https://huge-jasonism.vulcanwm.repl.co/profile).</p>
